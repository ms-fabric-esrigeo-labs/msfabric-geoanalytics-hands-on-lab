# msfabric-geoanalytics-hands-on-lab
Welcome!

This hands-on lab is designed to help you explore what’s possible when large-scale geospatial analytics meets Microsoft Fabric—using Esri spatial data and GeoAnalytics in a modern, cloud-native analytics workflow.

Rather than focusing on theory, **this lab walks you through practical patterns for ingesting, preparing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data** at scale using PySpark and Fabric-native capabilities. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how location intelligence can be embedded directly into enterprise analytics and AI workflows.
**You don’t need to be a GIS expert to get value from this lab.** If you’re curious about how spatial data can enrich analytics, decision-making, and AI outcomes in Fabric, you’re in the right place.

**Who Should Do This Lab**

- **GIS professionals and Esri users** who want to see how ArcGIS data and spatial analytics can be operationalized within Microsoft Fabric.
- **Data engineers and data scientists** who are familiar with Spark or Fabric and want to understand how spatial data fits into large-scale analytics pipelines.
- **Analytics and BI professionals** looking to enrich reports, trends, and insights with location-aware context using enterprise data platforms.
- **Solution architects and technical decision makers** evaluating patterns for geospatial workloads, AI readiness, and governed analytics on Microsoft platforms.

If you’ve ever wondered **“How do I bring geospatial intelligence into my analytics platform without building a custom stack?”** —this lab is for you.

**Why This Lab Matters**

Location data adds critical context to enterprise analytics—but it’s often isolated from the rest of the data estate. This lab shows how to change that.

By completing this lab, you’ll learn how to:
- **Integrate Esri spatial data directly into Microsoft Fabric**
- **Perform spatial operations, aggregation, clustering, and hotspot analysis at scale**
- **Use PySpark and GeoAnalytics patterns that align with modern data engineering practices**
- **Enable location-aware insights that can feed analytics, BI, and downstream AI scenarios**

Most importantly, you’ll walk away with repeatable patterns you can apply to real-world use cases across industries such as public sector, utilities, infrastructure, and commercial analytics—without treating geospatial as a silo. 

>⚠️# - **IMPORTANT: Each lab is designed to be completed within an hour and each session will only be available for 12 hours after registering and launching the lab. After that your session will expire and be deleted**.
