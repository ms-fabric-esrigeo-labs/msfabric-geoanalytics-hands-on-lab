# Lab 3 — Spatial Operations and Properties

This lab introduces advanced spatial operations and geometry analysis,
including:

- Geometry transformation and spatial reference systems
- Buffering (planar and geodesic)
- Distance and proximity analysis
- H3 spatial binning
- Area, length, and shortest-path calculations
- Planar vs. geodesic comparisons

> Refer to CloudLabs for execution details and validation.
